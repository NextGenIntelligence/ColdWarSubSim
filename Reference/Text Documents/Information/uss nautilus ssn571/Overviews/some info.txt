COLD WAR SUB SIM INFO

AN/WQC-2 Panel




The first launch of a cruise missile (SSM-N-8 Regulus) from a submarine occurred in July 1953, from the deck of USS Tunny, a World War II fleet boat modified to carry this missile with a nuclear warhead. Tunny and its sister boat, Barbero, were the United States' first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines. In the 1950s, nuclear power partially replaced diesel-electric propulsion. Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water. These two innovations gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months.[26][27] Most of the naval submarines built since that time in the United States, the Soviet Union/Russia, Britain and France have been powered by nuclear reactors.

In 1959–1960, the first ballistic missile submarines were put into service by both the United States (George Washington class) and the Soviet Union (Golf class) as part of the Cold War nuclear deterrent strategy.
USS Charlotte, a Los Angeles-class submarine steams in a close formation with submarines from partner nations during RIMPAC 2014.

During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained large submarine fleets that engaged in cat-and-mouse games. The Soviet Union suffered the loss of at least four submarines during this period: K-129 was lost in 1968 (which the CIA attempted to retrieve from the ocean floor with the Howard Hughes-designed ship Glomar Explorer), K-8 in 1970, K-219 in 1986, and Komsomolets in 1989 (which held a depth record among military submarines—1000 m). Many other Soviet subs, such as K-19 (the first Soviet nuclear submarine, and the first Soviet sub to reach the North Pole) were badly damaged by fire or radiation leaks. The US lost two nuclear submarines during this time: USS Thresher due to equipment failure during a test dive while at its operational limit, and USS Scorpion due to unknown causes.


The Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM) space contained the equipment used to detect electronic transmissions generated by other vessels. Detecting these transmissions was helpful to ensure the ship remained undetected by radar and to detect the presence of enemy signals.

 The Control Room is located directly below the Attack Center, and contains all the instruments and controls for diving, surfacing and steering the ship. The Diving Officer of the Watch was in charge of this space and received orders for depth, course and speed from the Officer of the Deck in the Attack Center.

 

The Planesmen operated the stern and bow planes to control the ship's angle and depth. The Helmsman controlled the ship's rudder in order to change the ships course. 

ICV Panel

The individule cell voltage panel was used for monitoring the voltage of the subs batteries.

Located across from the Crew's Mess is the Chief Petty Officer's Quarters. Chief Petty Officers are the senior enlisted men on board and have their own separate living area where they could relax while off watch.

The Galley prepared food for the enlisted and officers. Next to the galley is the scullery where dishes were washed and other cleaning chores took place.


Crews Quarters USS Nautilus

Directly aft in the torpedo room is a small berthing area with 10 bunks, toilets, shower, and sinks. Each of the bunks could be opened to reveal a stowage area for crew members personal belongings. The only privacy offered to crew members was by a small curtain on their bunks. Visitors will notice many pin-up pictures throughout the ship. These pictures are historical, often representing wives and girlfriends of former crew members.

The "Electro-Magnetic Log" was used to indicate ship's speed. The "Sword" was lowered from this station. When the "Sword" was lowered it sensed water flow around it, sending an electromagnetic signal that was converted to the ship's speed. The term "Log" is a carry-over from the days of tall ships, when a wooden log was thrown over the side of the ship to approximate ship's speed.

Across from the Firing Panel is the "Conn."; Located here are the ship's two periscopes. The periscopes served as the "eyes" of the ship, allowing the crew to see objects on the surface when the ship was submerged at periscope depth. The Officer of the Deck stood his watch here.

Re: GUPPY snorkels (undoubtablly a similar system was used on SSN571 "The Guppy bow dug deeply into the waves and the step sail was little protection.  Control during snorkeling was difficult at  best and sometimes impossible.  The snorkel induction, topped by the head valve, had to be kept out of the water.  If it ducked to the surface or below, or a wave hit it, it would automatically slam shut.  The diesel engines would keep running for a short time removing some sixteen thousand cubic feet of air from the boat's internal atmosphere per minute per engine.  It would take from ten to thirty seconds for the engines to draw enough vacuum in the boat to shut down automatically after the snorkel induction head valve shut depending on whether the boat was running on one or two engines.  This occurred at a vacuum of six inches of mercury below atmosphere.  This equivalent to a 6000-foot altitude.  Sometimes the head valve would shut for five or six seconds then reopen as the snorkel induction again cleared the surface.  The atmospheric pressure would return to normal in the next few seconds, then the head valve would shut as another wave passed.  This cycle would occur over and over for days and days."

Fleet snorkals/guppys "BQR-2 sonar in the chin mount and had sonar in the space vacated by the magazine under the galley.  The auxillary engine was replaced with two air conditioning plants"

Capstains and deck cleats were made retractable and deck rail stanchion supports were
  inset in the deck.   All deck railings were removed when the boat rigged for dive.
-The Fleet Boat bow was was removed and a rounded bow replaced it.  The "Guppy Bow."

Internally

-Ammunition magazine was removed from under the galley and the chill and freeze boxes
  were moved to the after battery upper level.
-Battery power was increased with installation of 4 126 cell batteries.  One and one-half of
  the batteries were put in the forward well in the lower level of the forward battery.  One-
  half of a battery was put into the forward end of the pump room.  Two complete batteries
  were placed in the after battery well.
-The battery cells (Gupy Battery) had more, thinner plates and would generate higher amps
  for a longer time.  However, this battery had a shorter life span, longer charging time,          and required cooling water to be circultated through the battery terminals and termination    bars
-Sonar was increased to include the BQR-2 or 2A with hydrophones mounted under the
  forefoot in a chin mount and inboard electronics housed in the forward torpedo room.
-Two or four high speed motor and reduction gear configuration were replaced by slow
  speed motors. 
-The batteries could be connected in series or parallel and the combination possible from
  this arrangement gave a wide speed range.
-All open front switchboards were replaced with enclosed units.
-120 volt 60 hz AC and 120 volt 400 Hz electrical systems were introduced for lighting and
  electronics.  
  
  re: ESM equipment The Conning Tower was renewed with an attitional 5 foot section to accomodate the Mk 101 fire control system and Mk 37 director.  The Guppy III conversion was accomplished as a part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program.  These four-battery, four-engine boats became Guppy III.  The "Northern Sail" was also added, as it was on other classes of Guppys,  in order to get the bridge higher which allowed it to be manned in severe weather. 
  
  "The need for radar picket submarines came as a direct result of the vulnerability of surface radar ships.  The theory beingthat submarines coiuld dive at the first indication of incoming hostile aircraft, thus evading the enemy and avoiding attack.  Surface ships, however, were always vulnerable and never wandered far from the fleet.  Submarines could go anywhere at anytime and would be virtually undetected.  That was the theory anyway.
In 1947, the submarine-base radar picket program began.  It consisted of installing the same electronic equipment found on Edsall-class destroyers onto submarines.  This amount of equipment crammed into a World War II fleet boat would be one big headache, thus the name MIGRAINE.  Eventually, there would be three different versions of the MIGRAINE configuration on submarines.  Each one is more advanved that the other. "

re: SSG: Guided Missile Submarines

Note:  The information below is partial material taken from "The Fleet Submarine in the U.S. Navy", by John D. Alden. pages 135 and 136.

    "In 1947 the fleet submarine Cusk (SS348) was fitted with a launching ramp and control equipment and on
12 February 1947 fired the first guided missle from the deck of a submarine.  The Carbonero (SS337) was also assigned to the program as a control ship; to take command of the missile when it passed out of the range of the firing ship.  Later in the year the Cusk was fitted with an SV-4 radar and a cylindrical hangar aft of the conning tower, and in 1948 was redesignated an SSG.  The Carbonero was given a fleet-snorkel conversion in 1951-52 but kept her missle-launching equipment."
    Guidance equipment for the Regulus I was installed on the Carbonero in 1953......  The Cusk was modernized in 1954 and fitted with a snorkel.....  All remaining missile equipment was finally removed from both the Carbonero and the Cusk in 1961.  .......The Trounce program was carried on with the conversion of the Tunny (SS282) to an SSG in 1953.  The conversion of the Tunny was much more extensive than on previous boats.  Alterations included a missile hanger, retractable launching platform, snorkel, streamlined sail, new electrical equipment, various electrical equipment changes, and fleet type five bladed propellers.  One main engine and the auxiliary engine were removed. 
    In order to provide a mate for the Tunny, the Barbero (SS317), was reconverted from a cargo carrier to an SSG in 1955  Alterations were kept to a minimum to include a folding ramp, hangar for two missiles, and necessary control and servicing equipment.  Two main engines were removed as well as the tubes aft.  She was given a snorkel but kept the old unstreamlined bridge fairwater.  She was capable of launch and control to a range of 200 miles from snorkel depth. 
    The Regulus I program was an interim program and provided a system for the Navy until the Regulus II program was developed.  The Regulus II program was implemented by diverting the new construction submarines Grayback and Growler.  The development of the Polaris ballistic missile program put a halt to the Regulus II program. 
    The Barbero was stricken in 1964 and the Tunny reverted to general purpose status in 1965.
