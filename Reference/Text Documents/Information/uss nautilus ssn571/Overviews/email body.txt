Your Service With SSN-571

Hello,
I found your email address among some of the Navys registers. Hope I am not bothering.

Me and my team are currently in the process of designing a very realistic submarine simulator video game (I'm not sure if your aware of the Silent Hunter series by video game giant company Ubisoft, but similar to those games only in the Cold War not WWII).

I am modelling the interior of the boat nearly down to every single nut and bolt and it will be fully explorable in 3D.

I am looking for stories, photos, information, documents, drawings, layouts, equipment, specifications etc about anything and everything regarding the Nautilus.

If you are willing to give any time for any of this please let me know, at this point I am especially looking for a) the layout of the ship (there are tons of pictures from her floating museum in CT but no details online about the exact layout of the ship) b) what equipment she carried (Ive got a little like the EM log and the ICV panel and AN/WQC-2 Panel but not much else) and c) any specifications of her, or her equipment.

Of course all this has to be legal, non-secret information and is purely voluntarily at this point just with the opportunity to share your knowledge with myself and my team, sub fanatics, and thousands upon thousands (the Silent Hunter series sold over ten million copies) of future players that enjoy simulating the submarine experience on their computers.
And of course your name/initials/anonymous credit in the games credits scenes and documentation.

Thank you for your time and hope to hear back,
Derek V.
