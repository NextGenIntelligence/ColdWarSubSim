# ColdWarSubSim
A indie game based on post WWII submarine simulation. Basically Silent Hunter 6, since UbiSoft no longer supports it, and there are no modern cold war subsims. Blender is used for model work and Unity is the game engine, code is mostly C# with some JavaScript and possible moving to C++ and Unreal4 in the future. 

# Basic Goals
1. Create a video game using the Unity game engine similar to the Silent Hunter series but based on the cold war, since World War 2 has been done over, and over again. The last cold war submarine simulator was back in the late 90s.
2. Allow anyone and anybody who has an interest in submarines, Unity, Blender and particularly a combination to add what they see would be a benefit to the game.
3. Create a business model once the game is ready to submit to Steam.

# Current Status (Feb 10, 2015)
-Started a GitHub repo to allow volunteers/partners to share, discuss, and add to the project.
-Most of the basic stuff in Unity is ready to refine. Modelling, animation & characters are current concerns. Especially modelling the attack and control compartment to a decent level so that a very early alpha can be released.
-Looking for partners (see below)

# "I want to help!"
We are a small team that consists of myself (Modelling, animation, sound, code (C#, JS and C++), graphic design (Photoshop, GIMP, Mari, Krita, Corel Painter), research (e-mail contact with Navy veterans of the era + the internet. On hand but not directly associated with the project is a coder (C++), 2 graphic designers (Photoshop and other Adobe programs), and a sound artist. 

Our current budget is near nil. Will be updated soon as the project has JUST gotten underway less than two weeks ago. We have potential small backing from a local business.

However currently as of Feb 10, 2015 all work is done in one (1) of five (5) ways. 
1) I scratch your back, you scratch mine: Anyone who can add in any noticeable way will have my full support in their current or future needs with any of my skills listed above.
2) Pure voluntary: For those who love the idea of open-source and freedom of knowledge plus a love of indie video games, submarines, Navies, cold war, 3D modelling, animating, Unity or a combination of these. 
3) Portfolio and Resume Building: Any work you put any noticable effort into can be included in your personal resume, portfolio, demo reel etc. your free to use our models in any of your future work as long as any projects started using them credit this original project here, we follow the GNU GPL v2 license.
4) Small payments. Any work done (See section "Paid Work" below) can be discussed beforehand on a small payment to be made via paypal in 30-60 days once the alpha is out. I'm not talking about 80$ an hour freelance work, at least not at this point, if I wanted a freelancer I would get one from an actual freelance website where the job can be bid upon however if you absolutly require payment for your work, it can be discussed however be forewarned this may omit you from the project. I'd rather spend longer creating this project than paying what little profit I make working from home.
5) A cut of potential future game sales. Any work done (See section "Paid Work" below) can be discussed for a cut of either early access sales, release sales, steam release sales, or a combination.

No matter what, if you want to work on this project in even the smallest ways you will get the oppertunity to have your name/username/or anonymous in the credits and documentation and website to show off you worked on an indie game.

# Paid Work (I want to help, but not for free)
If you have a desire to work on this project as a job, your in the wrong place. If you have a desire to work on this project but require some kind of monetary reward read this basic outline:
1) Everything will have to be discussed beforehand, if you commit a model you worked 50 hours on and say "There you go, that'll be 750$ at my rate please" your work is going to be deleted. A virtual contract will be signed for any paid work in other words.
2) Our budget will increase with time. If you require payment ahead of time ASAP, your probably in the wrong place. 
3) Partnership: if you'd like to add work with the idea of a cut of future sales (see "I want to help" section five (5) above) then again a contract will have to be negotiated and signed. No guarantee this game will ever make it into the sales stage. 

Most likely for any paid team member, I will supply a copy of ManicTime or a similar time tracking software. 

# So whats this game exactly?
At the time of writing (Feb 10, 2015) the current game overview is this.
You are the captain of a submarine that goes out on missions (a mix of scripted and random) during the cold war. However you are infact at war with Russia, thus you will be required to not only hunt her submarines and warships when they try to attack you, you will be required to attack their merchant shipping.

The game will follow history. When a certain class of submarine is historically available, you will have the opportunity to command it instead of your current class instead, at the expense of losing your crew and upgrades.

We start out in 1946 with a GUPPY class diesel-electric submarine not at war. Your taught the basics of of the game and how submarines work through a series of interactive tutorials (skippable) that take you into 1950 or so. At this point nuclear submarines are becoming a possibility (USS Nautilus, SSN-571 is the first nuclear submarine in the world, and thus will be your first real command). At this point you are asked to take her out on sea trials to explain how a nuclear submarine works. The campaign now begins.

1954 - You start as the captain of the newly commissioned USS Nautilus the world's first nuclear submarine. It differs in no way from the submarines of world war 2 except the fact that she only needs re-fuelling once every 18 months. Russia declares war.

With world war 3 looming Navy recruits are ready to serve on the most advanced ship in the world. You choose your crew from a large selection, 12 officers and 55 enlisted men. Each man is assigned to a certain part of the boat and each man has certain ability points (mechanical, weapons, leadership etc.). You spend all your initial upgrade points on your crew and your first load of provisions, ammo, and torpedoes. 

As new technology becomes available, you can choose to add it to your submarine, as long as its not totally un-realistic. This allows the player to build the boat that they want essentially. Taking out enemy ships (and eventually land targets when missiles become available) gains you upgrade points. You can spend them during patrol on your crews ability points to make them more efficient etc. Once your patrol is over (when you run out of provisions, ammo, mission success, or at your own choosing you head back to port. Going back to port takes 2 weeks of game time. In port you get more upgrade points based on how successful your patrol was (ships sunk, damage taken, equipment breakdowns etc.) which you can spend either on your crews abilities or on your boat (both historial and research ideas). You can also award medals to crew members you deem worthy (say they worked extra watches or kept cool under pressure etc.) and eventually they will upgrade in rank eventually all the way up the chain of command. 

When a new class of submarines is available you have the choice to choose command of her but you will lose all your upgrades to your previous boat, your crew and all their upgrades and promotions and have to start fresh, albeit with a small upgrade points refund depending how long you commanded the previous boat for and how well you did over your patrols. 

Crew members have passive abilities (IE. the sonar operator can be upgraded to increase the range he can hear sound underwater) which are enabled at all times and active abiltiies which you have to manually enable and are time based (IE. the torpedo officer can have his crew reload torpedos 25% faster for 2 hours). 

Crew members have moral and the longer the patrol, and the less experienced you, and they are, the less effective/slower they are and the greater change they will break equipment etc. 

You have to carry spare parts on board and harder difficulty levels will require you to decide what parts to take on patrol and what most likely isnt needed, but if a part breaks down with no backup system or parts, your patrol will end and you'll haver to wait for a rescue tug, and the enemy may find you in this time. 

Still in the planning stages. More ideas welcomed/coming.

# How hardcore of a simulation will this be?

At first we hope to keep it fairly arcade like to appeal to the most customers possible. However if time permits, and definitly eventually, we hope to have various difficulty levels ie.
Landlubber: Torpedos hit where you aim for in the periscope, ballast and trim water tanks are handled automatically, all you have to do is drive, upgrade, and attack. Your crew stays happy forever.
and various level all the way up to
Subnut: You are nuts about submarines! You have to make mental calculations and use a stopwatch, you have to control nearly every aspect of your boat or else you may face the depths of the ocean (reactor core temperature, equipment breakdowns, realistic reloading speeds, crew moral if your patrol lasts too long.


Eventually I plan to calculate everything from thermal layers (differnt water temperature layers that sound reflect off in the ocean), air velocity when blowing ballast/trim/negative tanks, to how often your crew showers and goes to the bathroom and uses up fresh water.

# I have an un-answered question. 

Feel free to email me (nsomnia, the project lead) at info@blendertek.com. I check my email constantly throughout the day. Forums/youtube/etc will get a slower reseponse.

# F.A.Q (Frequently asked questions)

1) What is the expected release date?
When the team is happy enough that they can be proud to show it off.

Myself, working alone, hope to have a version out where you can drive the USS Nautilus around on the surface of the ocean, some of the GUI done, and most of the interior done to explore by May 5th, 2015.

2) Is this open-source, free to play, pay to play? I'm confused.
While desigining, this game will be completely open-source (except anything that I buy like unity assets) and all credit will be given where due. Once the project is self sustaining and has money flowing in any files that are not permissable for commerical use will be redesigned in-house for an eventual early access sale. Then a version 1.0 release. Then Steam, if for some reason Steam doesnt accept it, we will publish it in-house. 

3) What software is being used?
I use Unity, Blender, Maya, 3ds Max, Photoshop, GIMP, Krita, Mari, Corel Painter, ManicTime, MakeHuman, zBrush 4R7, ShaderMap, NDo2, Realflow, Audacity, Audition, Camtasia Studio, Visual Studio 2013, Notepad++, and a bunch more. For the most part, Blender, Unity and Photoshop take up 95% of my time.
