# ColdWarSubSim
A indie game based on post WWII submarine simulation. Basically Silent Hunter 6, since UbiSoft no longer supports it, and there are no modern cold war subsims. Blender is used for model work and Unity is the game engine, code is mostly C# with some JavaScript and possible moving to C++ and Unreal4 in the future.
