# USS Nautilus (SSN-571) .Blends
This folder holds all the .Blends relating directly to the structure and hardware of USS Nautilus. 

## Current Status (Feb 27, 2015)
Consider no compartment ready to export yet. Work may be done in the Attack_Center_Control_Room_Compartment and Main_Quarters_Galley_Compartment anytime later than Feb 27th, 2015. Other compartments, please ask because the decks need to be measured by me or we need to collaborate on the layout and I would need to ask crew-members if the general layout is correct. 

- Paused work on Attack_Center_Control_Room_Compartment.blend it was getting too busy and posssibly too many meshes in one file, may export some meshes out into seperate meshes like the stairs and periscope for example, especially since the periscope will need to be animated anyway. HAVE NOT decided if placeholders should be left in place or not yet. 
- Started laying out the decks in Main_Quarters_Galley_Compartment.blend as the decks are the same height as in the Attack & Control compartment. 
- Going to lay out all the decks and the pressure hull exterior and bulkheads so that everything is standardized and ready to be worked on by anyone meaning no weird modeling or stray anything. **Clean and ready to go**
