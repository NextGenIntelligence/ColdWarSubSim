# Main Game Folder
This folder holds any project folder that has direct association with the game. This allows us to keep the main game project folder cleaner by testing knew and unknown ideas in separate, clone or empty projects. 

### Current Projects [Feb 27th, 2015]
- ColdWarSubSim :: The working UE4 project folder for the main game 
- Unity [OLD] :: All the old project folders from Unity

## Migrating Files Between Projects
If a file in one UE4 project needs to be used in another just make sure you've got the latest commit and open the project with the needed files in the Unreal Editor and then choose File -> Migrate to choose a different project to send the files to.
